A lightweight, portable programming language for both embedded use and stand-alone executables. Written entirely in C, Ember emphasizes:

### Performance & Minimal Overhead
A compact stack-based VM and optional AST interpreter are included, enabling usage from quick scripting tasks to entire application development.

### Simplicity & Extensibility
A clean syntax drawing inspiration from Lua, AngelScript, and Haxe.

### Adaptability
Capable of scaling from minimal environments to large-scale applications.

---

## Key Highlights

### Pure C Implementation
Ensures broad platform support and straightforward integration.

### Bytecode Compilation
Supports compilation to a fast, stack-based VM using the `emberc` command-line compiler, or interpretation of the AST directly.

### Feature-Rich
Encompasses coroutines, optional static typing, a user-friendly syntax, and other advanced capabilities.

### Standard Library & Modules
Provides a core library, with the ability to import and extend functionality through custom modules.

### Package Management
Offers `emberpm` to install and manage Ember modules.

### Future Roadmap
Macros and compile-time meta-programming, pattern matching, hot reloading, inline bytecode, advanced memory operations, and more.

Ember aims to blend the convenience of dynamic scripting languages with the reliability of statically typed systems â€” all within a minimalist, modern design. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
